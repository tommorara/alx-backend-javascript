# 0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program and focuses on advanced JavaScript ES6 features for handling and manipulating data. You'll explore how to effectively use arrays, sets, maps, and typed arrays while applying concepts such as `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and data structures like `Set`, `Map`, and `WeakMap`.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Use `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` functions on arrays.
- Understand and utilize `TypedArray` objects.
- Manipulate data using `Set`, `Map`, and `WeakMap`.
- Combine functional programming methods with ES6 data structures.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- All files will be interpreted on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **NodeJS 12.11.x**.
- Code must pass ESLint and all Jest tests using the command `npm run full-test`.
- Use `.js` extension for JavaScript files.
- All your functions must be exported.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory.
